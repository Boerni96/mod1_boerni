                <div>
                    <p>The Northside Youth Soccer League was established in 1996 to provide athletes residing in Chicago's northside neighbourhoods an environment in which to learn and play soccer. To be a member of NYSL, you must be between the ages of 4-12 and reside in a Chicago northside neighbourhood. NYSL is ran by a small full-time staff, and relies on the generous volunteer time of parents and previous league members.</p>
